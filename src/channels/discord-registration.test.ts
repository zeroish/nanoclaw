/**
 * Integration test for the discord channel's single reach-in: the self-registration
 * import in the `src/channels/index.ts` barrel. Importing the barrel runs discord.ts's
 * top-level `registerChannelAdapter('discord', …)`; without the import the channel is
 * silently absent.
 *
 * Behavior, not structural: it imports the real barrel and asserts the registry
 * actually contains the channel. This reflects what happens at host boot — if the
 * `import './discord.js';` line is deleted, or the barrel fails to evaluate for any
 * reason (so the channel genuinely would not register), this goes red. A structural
 * check of the import line would falsely pass in that second case.
 *
 * Importing the barrel is safe: registration is a pure top-level call, and discord.ts
 * builds the SDK adapter / bridge only inside its factory (invoked at host startup),
 * never at import. It does require the adapter package (`@chat-adapter/discord`) to be installed,
 * which holds in a composed install: the skill's `pnpm install` step runs before this
 * test — so this test also implicitly guards that dependency (an unmocked import throws
 * if the package is missing).
 *
 * discord is a Chat SDK channel: discord.ts also consumes a load-bearing *core* API —
 * `createChatSdkBridge(...)` from ./chat-sdk-bridge.js. That core-consumption is a
 * typed call, so the build/typecheck leg (`pnpm run build`) guards it against upstream
 * drift, not this test. Every Chat SDK channel follows this same shape.
